They struggled to maintain consistent product quality across different production batches, leading to increased rejections and customer dissatisfaction.\n\nSolution\n\n: To overcome this challenge, the company adopted an IoT-driven Quality Control and Monitoring System. IoT sensors were integrated into the production process to monitor critical parameters such as fabric quality, stitching accuracy, and dye consistency in real-time. Data collected from the sensors was analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify deviations and defects. This allowed for immediate adjustments, resulting in improved product quality and reduced rejections."}
